    <h1> Do I have a personality? ...Let me check. I'm not quite sure... Oh here it is, I think I found it. </h2>
        <p> I am a very scholastic person, who works hard to maintain a high GPA. I like to be funny and make my friends and family laugh. I like to think of myself as a nice person, who always tries his best to do right by others, but sometimes I have troubles with that. In most of my life, I'm pretty soft spoken and relaxed, but in settings with my friends where I can feel fully comfortable I can become much more energetic and outgoing. </p>
        <h1> Fun Facts!... about me, not just in general. </h2>
            <p> I like to play video games and watch videos on YouTube. I am recently a theatre kid and I'm in the fall play this year. I really like computers and have built a computer of my own in my personal life. I use it primarily for video games, but I also use it for general uses and homework too. I'm a big movie fan and love to watch new movies, also movies with my friends when a movie we want to watch comes out. </p>
            <h1> Academic goals and stuff </h2>
                <p> In my academic career, I always strive for a 4.0 GPA. I always try to take complex and difficult courses to test my limits. I always love an academic challenge and keep my ambitions and aspirations high. I genuinely like to learn, so school has never been a huge issue for me really. </p>
